## Creating Software Tools and Demonstrations for Studying Networks of Oscillators

Software tools are key to exploring the behavior of both nonlinear systems and dynamics coupled over networks. This project creates software examples using Python network analysis wool NetworkX. The examples will involve mathematial ideas from Graph Theory and Differential Equations. It would be very cool to create a tool that makes simulating networks of coupled oscillators fairly flexible in terms of network structure and choosing equations for oscillators. This would make an excellent demo for the open source software package NetworkX and the Python code resulting from this project could be released in that format.
